# REST based microservices API development in Golang 
In this course, you will learn microservices API development using the Hexagonal Architecture. We will start the development from the scratch. Taking the small steps, we will be building the foundation by continuously improving the design of the application. We will explore how the dependency inversion plays a pivotal role in implementing the Hexagonal architecture.
